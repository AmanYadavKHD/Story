We're thrilled to be back in Las Vegas for Adobe Summit next week. In addition to unveiling several new innovations across Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, we will share how we are building on our decades of AI leadership to deliver generative AI technologies that redefine creativity and customer experiences. We look forward to seeing you there. Adobe's employees around the world motivate us to continuously raise the bar and create the future. This quarter, we were named to Glassdoor's Best Places to Work, Bloomberg's Gender- Equality Index for the fifth year in a row; and the CDP A List, which recognizes leadership and environmental impact. Our renowned brand, mission-critical products, and vast base of customers create an unmatched advantage that will fuel our growth. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator?"

Can you share with us what those are and how those assumptions might have changed from a few months ago when you last guided? 6/3/25, 1:14 AM ADBE - Transcripts https://app.koyfin.com/news/ts/eq-tt4i45/all/1819050563?sourceType=transcript 7/18"

content"Yes. Thanks, Brad. There's really no change in our view in the macro environment. I think we're pretty clear, at the time we set our annual guidance, the environment that we're in. We see the environment that others see. I think you can see that the company is performing really well against that backdrop. So we feel good about how we're situated, the way in which we're engaging with customers and its broad diversified performance across that environment. And so we like how we're set up, but there's really no change to the assumptions underlying the macro environment. We see the same environment that others do."

content"So maybe just what do you think is the driving force behind -- so many companies are talking about longer sales cycles, difficulty closing business. You had an outstanding quarter, specifically within the Enterprise. So maybe what's driving those macro headwinds for others that you're not seeing, or your resiliency specifically? And then on the topic of metrics, every metric was strong as we looked at revenues, RPO, Digital Media ARR, operating margins. But maybe just can you talk about deferred revenue in the quarter? Anything there that was a headwind? Because it did look like free cash flow was a little bit lighter than what we were expecting."

content"I'll take the first, Alex, and then maybe Dan can speak to the second. I mean I think, as Dan said, when we look at the macroeconomic situation, and you can see strong companies actually refer to this across the board, whether it's consumers, whether it's small and medium businesses, whether it's enterprises globally, I think the reality is that digital for them is an imperative. And really for companies that have innovative solutions, it's a tailwind. I think what a lot of companies are focused on is the message that enterprises are certainly sharing, is that if the prior focus was growth at any cost, certainly, they're looking for more profitable growth. And I think if you look at our solutions on the Creative, Document or Enterprise side, we help them. We help them with growth, but we help them with profitable growth and engaging with customers. The second thing I would say is that there's a large TAM here. And so I think our job in this environment is making sure that we have an even larger pipeline that we go address and attract because there may be some difference in the closure rates. But I think if you look at it in aggregate, our job is looking at it and saying how do we differentiate ourselves. I think the one thing also I would say, Alex, is that a lot of the companies that have single product offerings, I think they are probably seeing more headwind because a certain company may not put one part of what they offer as a priority. And I think a lot of the companies are looking at it and saying, "If we're engaging in digital, we might change our focus from content management to the implementation of the customer data platform," or there might be a focus more on 6/3/25, 1:14 AM ADBE - Transcripts https://app.koyfin.com/news/ts/eq-tt4i45/all/1819050563?sourceType=transcript 8/18 campaigns or ensuring that the advertising spend, the attribution associated with it. So I think the team has executed against continuing to try and drive a large opportunity. The other thing I think we feel good about is the fact that both Summit as well as in the U.S. and U.K., we're looking forward to being in person because we can engage more in person with them. So hopefully, that gives you some color of why perhaps the stronger companies are showing more macro strength than other companies.

und the corner in Las Vegas at the Venetian Convention and Expo Center beginning on Tuesday, March 21. Following the Day 1 keynote, we will host a Q&A session with financial analysts and investors in attendance at 11:30 a.m. Pacific Time. Audio of the event will be broadcast live, and the replay will be available on Adobe's IR website. More details about Summit and the agenda are available at summit.adobe.com. 6/3/25, 1:14 AM ADBE - Transcripts https://app.koyfin.com/news/ts/eq-tt4i45/all/1819050563?sourceType=transcript 1/18 I will now turn the call over to Shantanu."
sult, more and more people are turning to Creative Cloud, which remains a preeminent destination for creativity across imaging, design, video, illustration and animation, as well as new media types like 3D and augmented reality. We continue to see strong demand for our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Acrobat and are excited about the traction we're getting with Adobe Express. Q1 was a strong quarter for Creative Cloud. We achieved net new Creative ARR of $307 million and revenue of $2.76 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year. Q1 highlights include strong growth in top-of-funnel traffic, which resulted in healthy new demand for creative cloud applications across all routes to market and customer segments globally, from individuals to SMBs, to large enterprises. 6/3/25, 1:14 AM ADBE - Transcripts https://app.koyfin.com/news/ts/eq-tt4i45/all/1819050563?sourceType=transcript 2/18 Increased demand and mobile adoption in imaging with products like Photoshop and Lightroom. Lightroom mobile is now the default photo editor for the high-end photo editing experience on the Samsung Galaxy S-23 Series. Continued momentum for Premier Pro, After Effects and Frame.io, which are leaders in video editing and collaboration. Over 2/3 of films at Sundance, as well as Oscar winners Everything Everywhere All at Once and Navalny, were edited with our video products. Rapid adoption of Substance 3D by brands such as Amazon, Burberry and Louis Vuitton. The Substance 3D team was honored with a technical Oscar in recognition of 3D capabilities that are making popular fi
uments are powering productivity at home and at work, whether users are filing a tax form, submitting a sales contract, requesting feedback on a marketing campaign or completing an online bank transaction. Adobe Document Cloud is a leader in digital documents, redefining how people view, edit, share, scan and sign documents across desktop, Web and mobile. In Q1, Document Cloud had record revenue of $634 million, which represents 16% year-over- year growth and strong net new ARR of $103 million, with ending ARR growing 22% year-over- year in constant currency. Q1 highlights include continued demand for PDF with outstanding growth in documents opened in the Acrobat Chrome extension and a new integration that will make Acrobat Reader the default PDF viewer in Microsoft Edge for over 1 billion Windows users; significant growth in monthly active users for Acrobat Web driven by search volume for PDF-related verbs and a continually optimized funnel to our Web offering; continued proliferation of Acrobat driven by demand for integrated functionality such as Share for Review for collaboration and Adobe Sign for e-signatures; outstanding increase in API transactions as our ecosystem and business 6/3/25, 1:14 AM ADBE - Transcripts https://app.koyfin.com/news/ts/eq-tt4i45/all/1819050563?sourceType=transcript 3/18 customers continue to customize and integrate document services; strong demand across all routes to market and customer segments globally, from individuals, to SMBs, to large enterprises; key customer wins include Bank of Montreal, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Ministry of Defense of Netherlands, Samsung and Verizon. Given the strong Q1, the demand for our products and our innovation road map, we're pleased to raise our FY '23 Digital Media net new ARR target. I'll now pass it t
s. So let me take them in reverse order. In terms of cash taxes, there's a 5-year amortization period around the capitalization of that R&D. So you'll see a pretty dramatic cash tax step-up initially. But over that 5-year amortization period, it will converge on the reported tax rate. And so that's the general profile, and that's why you see the significant step-up in Q1 just starting that process now. 6/3/25, 1:14 AM ADBE - Transcripts https://app.koyfin.com/news/ts/eq-tt4i45/all/1819050563?sourceType=transcript 9/18 In terms of the environment we're in, clearly, the company is performing well.
