content"Thanks, Dan. Adobe's Q1 results underscore our strong momentum and the significant opportunities we have across our businesses. We're thrilled to be back in Las Vegas for Adobe Summit next week. In addition to unveiling several new innovations across Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, we will share how we are building on our decades of AI leadership to deliver generative AI technologies that redefine creativity and customer experiences. We look forward to seeing you there. Adobe's employees around the world motivate us to continuously raise the bar and create the future. This quarter, we were named to Glassdoor's Best Places to Work, Bloomberg's Gender- Equality Index for the fifth year in a row; and the CDP A List, which recognizes leadership and environmental impact. Our renowned brand, mission-critical products, and vast base of customers create an unmatched advantage that will fuel our growth. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator?"

Can you share with us what those are and how those assumptions might have changed from a few months ago when you last guided? 6/3/25, 1:14 AM ADBE - Transcripts https://app.koyfin.com/news/ts/eq-tt4i45/all/1819050563?sourceType=transcript 7/18"

content"Yes. Thanks, Brad. There's really no change in our view in the macro environment. I think we're pretty clear, at the time we set our annual guidance, the environment that we're in. We see the environment that others see. I think you can see that the company is performing really well against that backdrop. So we feel good about how we're situated, the way in which we're engaging with customers and its broad diversified performance across that environment. And so we like how we're set up, but there's really no change to the assumptions underlying the macro environment. We see the same environment that others do."

content"So maybe just what do you think is the driving force behind -- so many companies are talking about longer sales cycles, difficulty closing business. You had an outstanding quarter, specifically within the Enterprise. So maybe what's driving those macro headwinds for others that you're not seeing, or your resiliency specifically? And then on the topic of metrics, every metric was strong as we looked at revenues, RPO, Digital Media ARR, operating margins. But maybe just can you talk about deferred revenue in the quarter? Anything there that was a headwind? Because it did look like free cash flow was a little bit lighter than what we were expecting."

content"I'll take the first, Alex, and then maybe Dan can speak to the second. I mean I think, as Dan said, when we look at the macroeconomic situation, and you can see strong companies actually refer to this across the board, whether it's consumers, whether it's small and medium businesses, whether it's enterprises globally, I think the reality is that digital for them is an imperative. And really for companies that have innovative solutions, it's a tailwind. I think what a lot of companies are focused on is the message that enterprises are certainly sharing, is that if the prior focus was growth at any cost, certainly, they're looking for more profitable growth. And I think if you look at our solutions on the Creative, Document or Enterprise side, we help them. We help them with growth, but we help them with profitable growth and engaging with customers. The second thing I would say is that there's a large TAM here. And so I think our job in this environment is making sure that we have an even larger pipeline that we go address and attract because there may be some difference in the closure rates. But I think if you look at it in aggregate, our job is looking at it and saying how do we differentiate ourselves. I think the one thing also I would say, Alex, is that a lot of the companies that have single product offerings, I think they are probably seeing more headwind because a certain company may not put one part of what they offer as a priority. And I think a lot of the companies are looking at it and saying, "If we're engaging in digital, we might change our focus from content management to the implementation of the customer data platform," or there might be a focus more on 6/3/25, 1:14 AM ADBE - Transcripts https://app.koyfin.com/news/ts/eq-tt4i45/all/1819050563?sourceType=transcript 8/18 campaigns or ensuring that the advertising spend, the attribution associated with it. So I think the team has executed against continuing to try and drive a large opportunity. The other thing I think we feel good about is the fact that both Summit as well as in the U.S. and U.K., we're looking forward to being in person because we can engage more in person with them. So hopefully, that gives you some color of why perhaps the stronger companies are showing more macro strength than other companies.
